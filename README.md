The Sorting Visualizer is a web-based application designed to provide an interactive and visual representation of various sorting algorithms. It offers an engaging way to comprehend how different sorting methods operate by sorting an array of vertical bars. By dynamically illustrating the sorting process, users can gain a deeper understanding of these algorithms and how they impact the order of elements in a collection.

Sorting Algorithms:
The Sorting Visualizer supports multiple sorting algorithms, including:

Bubble Sort: Iteratively compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

Insertion Sort: Builds a sorted array by repeatedly inserting an element into the appropriate position.

Selection Sort: Divides the array into a sorted and an unsorted portion, selecting the smallest element each time and swapping it into the sorted portion.

Merge Sort: Divides the array into smaller subarrays, sorts them, and then merges them back together in the correct order.

Quick Sort: Selects a pivot element, partitions the array around the pivot, and recursively sorts the subarrays.

Heap Sort: Builds a max-heap from the array and repeatedly extracts the maximum element to obtain a sorted result.

Interactive Controls:

The visualizer provides interactive controls to customize the sorting process, including:

Array Size: Users can adjust the size of the array, allowing them to observe how the sorting algorithms handle different amounts of data.
Sorting Speed: Users can control the speed at which the sorting algorithm executes, enabling them to slow down or speed up the visualization as needed.

Real-time Visualization:
The main highlight of the sorting visualizer is its real-time graphical representation. The array elements are represented by vertical bars, and as the sorting algorithm progresses, the bars move, swap positions, or change color to illustrate the sorting steps. This visual feedback enhances the understanding of how the algorithms work and how they affect the arrangement of elements.

Step-by-step Execution:
The visualizer also offers a step-by-step execution mode, allowing users to observe the sorting process in a more detailed manner. This mode enables users to manually move through each step of the algorithm, providing insights into the comparisons, swaps, and recursive calls involved in sorting.
